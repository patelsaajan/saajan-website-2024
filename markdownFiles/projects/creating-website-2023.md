Coding has been a longstanding interest of mine. I initially chose my degree program with the expectation of learning Python alongside other engineering skills. However, regrettably, Python was removed from the syllabus. Throughout my degree, I did manage to acquire some Python skills, along with MATLAB, which provided a strong foundation for most programming languages. In my spare time, I made attempts to explore other languages like Swift and JavaScript, but often found it challenging to allocate enough time while balancing my coursework.

In September 2023, I was initially set to start my first job, but it got postponed. I took this as an opportunity to join some friends for a journey through Asia. I also viewed it as a chance to dedicate some of my free time to further developing my coding skills and pursuing my interests in various languages, both expanding my knowledge and honing the ones I already knew. This website was conceived and developed during my travels, reflecting this period of exploration and learning.
