This is not a reflection of my personal life fyi i dont go on dates too busy with the creaft.

<p>To be honest, the best way to make this one is to go with the flow and use whatever leftovers you have in your kitchen. It's the kind of recipe where you just toss things in and figure it out as you go along. However, I'll give you the basics, and you can take it from there and get creative with what you have on hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Slice the garlic into thin cross-section-exposed pieces, and do the same with the chilies. Heat a large base pan and add oil, ensuring it's hot but not frying anything. Once the oil is heated, add the chili and garlic, allowing them to infuse into the oil. Let them cook until the garlic slowly turns crispy and golden brown. This should take approximately ten minutes, but the exact time may vary based on how thick you sliced the ingredients and the heat you're using. Just be careful not to burn them. If you've chosen to use sun-dried tomatoes, you can add them about five minutes into cooking the garlic and chilies. </p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">While the oil is infusing, you can start preparing the pasta. Boil some water, add a pinch of salt, and if you're feeling like a grown-up, use brown pasta. Once the water is boiling, add your pasta and set a timer for ten minutes. It should come out perfectly cooked every time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">After your pasta is cooked, drain it, but be sure to save some pasta water. Once the garlic and chilis have infused the oil, toss in the fresh parsley. I'd recommend giving the parsley a rough chop before adding it, or you can cut it to any size you prefer. Then, add the pasta into the oil pan, give it a good stir, and incorporate some of the pasta water you saved to create a nice sauce.</p>
