    story: ["During my university years, my flatmate introduced an intriguing habit. He left hard-boiled eggs in a Korean marinade  and allowed them to rest in the fridge for a few days. The aroma of that marinating liquid was truly exceptional. He would often encourage me to try it as well, and although I was generally interested, I frequently found myself unable to find the time or was, to be honest, somewhat lacking in motivation – perhaps a combination of both.", "After a few weeks, I eventually managed to find some time, particularly after my deadlines had passed, to give the dish a try. Surprisingly, the preparation itself didn't take much time at all. However, the marinating period is what tests your patience. Unlike eggs, which are quick to prepare, getting the flavors to properly infuse requires a few days of waiting, but it's certainly worth every moment of anticipation.", "In May 2023, I paid a visit to my mate's house and decided to treat him and his family to this recipe. While we were in the process of preparing the meal, his mum had a brilliant idea. She suggested adding some chili oil she had recently received from Japan, and it turned out to be a fantastic suggestion."]

This method is actually quite straightforward, and even someone like Nikeisha can get it right on the first try. As for quantities, it's more about feeling it out – that's how you achieve the best-tasting food. If you're expecting a step-by-step recipe with precise measurements, you might have come to the wrong place :/.

<p style="margin-top: 30px">As with any tofu dish, begin by draining the tofu to remove any excess water. After that, proceed to cut the tofu into your preferred shape. I typically opt for strips, but cubes work just as well.<p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Slice the green onions, garlic, and chilis into thin, evenly-sized pieces as well as dice the onion. After cutting them, place them in your container. Then, add an equal mix of soy sauce and water, maintaining a 50/50 ratio. If you're including chili oil, you can add about 3-4 spoonfuls to the mix at this point.<p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Fill the container to about halfway full, but before you add any more liquid, carefully place your tofu in the container to prevent overflow. While you're stacking the tofu in the container, sprinkle some sesame seeds over it for added flavor.
<p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">After placing all the tofu in the container, seal it and put it in the fridge for the next few days. If you have the energy, I recommend giving the tofu a gentle stir or shuffle every few days, as it can help the flavors permeate the tofu more evenly. For the best results, I'd suggest leaving it in the fridge for at least five days to achieve a more pronounced effect.<p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">I found this dish goes well with rice as per but also shallow fried battered oyster mushrooms. If you can't figure out how to fry the mushrooms just ask i cba to type it here.<p>
