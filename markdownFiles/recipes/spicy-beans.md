    story: ["If you ever find yourself growing tired of the same old baked beans and are craving something a bit more exciting, then this recipe is just the thing for you. I initially started cooking this with my flatmate as a way to add some pizzazz to plain baked beans, but you can easily swap out those sugary canned beans for tinned tomatoes and a bean variety of your choice." , "The dish featured in the display image was prepared on my last day during a visit to my friend Tatsuki's house in Pembrokeshire. Tatsuki, his dad, and I savored this meal while sitting in the new front garden with adorable baby chicks scampering around us and the morning summer rays beating down on us. It was an absolutely stunning setting to enjoy this dish in."]

<p>To be honest, the best way to make this one is to go with the flow and use whatever leftovers you have in your kitchen. It's the kind of recipe where you just toss things in and figure it out as you go along. However, I'll give you the basics, and you can take it from there and get creative with what you have on hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Begin by slicing your onion into a shape and size that brings you joy. I'd personally recommend finely dicing it, as I prefer my onions to disintegrate into the sauce and disappear. However, if you fancy onion strips, that can work too. Next, mince the garlic and slice the chilis and set aside.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Place a saucepan over medium-high heat and add some oil to it. I typically use vegetable oil for frying, as using olive oil can diminish the flavor and is more costly, or so I've been told. Once the oil is hot, add the onions and fry them until they are just about to turn orange. Then, introduce the minced garlic and sliced chilis. You might want to reduce the heat of the pan and cook them for 2-3 minutes, or just long enough so that they are cooked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Now, lower the heat and incorporate all the dry seasonings you prefer. My go-to choices are oregano, paprika, cumin powder, salt, and pepper, but feel free to add whatever seasonings you enjoy. Give it a good stir, then add the canned tomatoes and a mug or two of water. Allow it to simmer and reduce on higher heat for about 5 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Afterward, add your choice of beans to the pot, along with some more water. Allow the beans to cook in the sauce for approximately 10 minutes. Once they're cooked to your liking, add a splash of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil. For an extra kick, you can even toss in some Tabasco sauce.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">To serve, I recommend some sourdough or any delightful bread of your choice. You could also prepare some guacamole to have on the side. It's a delicious complement to the dish.</p>
